# Music-Reactive-Staircase-Lights
The project aimed to create a new outlook towards our surroundings and to introduce pleasure and excitement in people who passes by. The project comprised of installation LEDs on the staircase which reacted according to the music being played beside it. 
The project involved the installation of five LED strip in each step, which in turn reacted to the frequency of the music column wise. Which in turn enabled us to create a soothing atmosphere during the TESLA expo .
